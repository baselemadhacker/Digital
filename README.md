Python-Based Image Processing Project
üìå Project Overview
This project implements a modular Python-based image processing pipeline using OpenCV and scikit-learn. The system covers essential techniques including brightness/contrast adjustment, Gaussian filtering, noise reduction, edge detection, feature extraction using SIFT, and classification using a Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) model with KMeans and KNN classifier.

The objective is to prepare images for classification and evaluate basic machine learning readiness from image data.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Code
Upload Your Image Dataset to Google Colab:

Folder structure:

swift
Copy
Edit
/content/images/class1/
                  /class2/
Run Each Cell in Order:

Cell 1: Imports and class definitions

Cell 2: Load and process images

Cell 3: Extract SIFT descriptors and build BoVW

Cell 4: Train/test classifier

Cell 5: Display classification report

Install Required Libraries (if needed):

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python-headless scikit-learn
üß™ Descriptions of Techniques Used
Technique	Description
Brightness/Contrast	Adjust image tone using cv2.convertScaleAbs.
Gaussian Filtering	Smooth image with cv2.GaussianBlur to reduce detail.
Denoising	Remove noise using Non-local Means via cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored.
Edge Detection	Use cv2.Canny for detecting object boundaries.
SIFT Feature Extraction	Detect keypoints and descriptors using cv2.SIFT_create().
Bag-of-Visual-Words	Cluster descriptors with KMeans and convert them to fixed-length histograms.
KNN Classification	Classify image categories using k-nearest neighbors.

‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations / Notes
SIFT Feature Extraction might return no descriptors for some images (e.g., uniform regions).

Bag-of-Words vectorizer requires enough keypoints across images (min n_clusters).

Training data should include a variety of images per class for better accuracy.

KMeans vocabulary is ideally trained on many images ‚Äî using a single image may fail.

Image resizing or grayscale conversion may improve performance depending on the dataset.
